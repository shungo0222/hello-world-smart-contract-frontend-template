# Hello World Smart Contract Frontend Template

This is the frontend starter file for [this tutorial](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/integrating-your-smart-contract-with-the-frontend) instead of [this starter file](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/hello-world-part-four-tutorial).

[This starter file](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/hello-world-part-four-tutorial) doesn't work for me because of [this error](https://github.com/shungo0222/hello-world-smart-contract/issues/4), So I created this with Next.js.
